# Exercise Tracker

A simple exercise tracker app built on the MERN (MongoDB,Express,React,Node) stack. This project is the portfolio project for CS 290
at Oregon State University.

The client folder contains the front end built in React. This is a single page application that contains 3 pages (Home page, Add page,
Edit page) as well as two components - ExerciseList and Exercise, which contains the user's inputs.

The server folder contains the back end, which is built with Node and Express, and follows REST API standards. MongoDB is used for the document database.
